## Personal

[__Simplex__](?location=simplex) - The super simple template engine.

[Github Repository](https://github.com/UncleDozer/simplex)

An open source project I am currently working on. The idea spawned from creating http://Webtastic-Development.net. I was searching for something simple and lightweight to make templating easier with markdown support. Just about everything I found was too heavy. So to make management as lightweight as possible, while still speeding up my workflow static pages, I started development of Simplex. It features Github flavoured MarkDown support using the fantastic [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/), a lightweight markdown parser written in PHP.

Simplex is inspired by [Kirby CMS](http://www.getkirby.com).

*Note:* Simplex is currently under development and probably nowhere near a release. It *is* however fully functional, though sparse on features.

Built with PHP and [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org).

[__NTP__](/new_tab_page) - A Simple New Tab Page

[Github Repository](https://github.com/UncleDozer/new_tab_page)

An open source new tab page. I was tired of all the over the top extensions and new tab pages so I made my own.

Built with HTML and vanilla JavaScript.

## Work

[__ShawnCagle.com__](http://shawncagle.com) - Shawn Cagle's portfolio

I developed the portfolio for the amazingly talented designer, Shawn Cagle. He supplied the design and I supplied the code. 

He wanted it developed using [KirbyCMS](http://getkirby.com) which is a flat-file based CMS that doesn't use MySQL. I thoroughly enjoyed working with it and created the theme from scratch.  This was my first project implementing a cms from the ground up without the use of plugins or premade themes.

During development, I also built a lightweight SASS library dubbed SeCSSY. The source code will be released via GitHub after it is cleaned up and commented.

Built with [KirbyCMS](http://getkirby.com), PHP, SASS, and SeCSSY

[__MyndDot.com__](http://mynddot.com) - The Homepage for the MyndDot app

A website built for the IOS app MyndDot. I was supplied with a PDF design.

This was my first time using Ajax ( via jQuery ) on the help page. My reasoning for using Ajax is so the help page could be expanded ( I was told that the support system would contain a lot more info after a few months of the app release. )

Built with PHP, Bootstrap, jQuery and Ajax.
