## Personal

[Simplex](?location=simplex) - The super simple template engine.

[Github Repository](https://github.com/UncleDozer/simplex)

An open source project I am currently working on. The idea was to make management as lightweight as possible, while still speeding up my workflow on smaller projects. It features Github flavoured MarkDown support using the fantastic [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/), a lightweight markdown parser written in PHP.

[NTP](new_tab_page) - A Simple New Tab Page

[Github Repository](https://github.com/UncleDozer/new_tab_page)

An open source new tab page. I was tired of all the over the top extensions and new tab pages so I made my own. I am currently developing a way to make it customizable using JavaScript to learn how to better use localstorage. Progress can be seen on the [Custom Branch](https://github.com/UncleDozer/new_tab_page/tree/custom)
