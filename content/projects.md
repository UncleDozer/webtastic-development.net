[__Simplex__](?location=simplex) - The super simple template engine.

[Github Repository](https://github.com/UncleDozer/simplex)

An open source project I am currently working on. The idea spawned from creating http://Webtastic-Development.net. I was searching for something simple and lightweight to make templating easier with markdown support. Just about everything I found was too heavy. So to make management as lightweight as possible, while still speeding up my workflow static pages, I started development of Simplex. It features Github flavoured MarkDown support using the fantastic [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/), a lightweight markdown parser written in PHP.

Simplex is inspired by [Kirby CMS](http://www.getkirby.com).

*Note:* Simplex is currently under development and probably nowhere near a release. It *is* however fully functional, though sparse on features.

Built with PHP.

[__NTP__](?location=new_tab_page) - A Simple New Tab Page

[Github Repository](https://github.com/UncleDozer/new_tab_page)

An open source new tab page. I was tired of all the over the top extensions and new tab pages so I made my own. I am currently developing a way to make it customizable using JavaScript to learn how to better use localstorage. Progress can be seen on the [Custom Branch](https://github.com/UncleDozer/new_tab_page/tree/custom) 

Built with PHP and vanilla JavaScript.
