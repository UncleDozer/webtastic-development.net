# Design A Day
To keep my frontend skills sharp, I've decided to code a new design every day. Sometimes these will be designs I've found ( on dribbble.com or elsewhere ) in which case I will give full credit to the author. This week is a custom designed card, inspired by Google's new Material Design.
